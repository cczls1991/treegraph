treestruct
==========

treestruct (temporary name?) is a Python library for extracting structural parameters from point clouds of individual trees.

This is still a work in progress and many features might change in the near future. 

Any contributions or suggestions for new features are welcome!

The TLSeparation library is being developed as part of my PhD research, supervised by Prof. Dr. Mat Disney, in the Department of Geography at University College London (UCL). My research 
is funded through Science Without Borders from the National Council of Technological and Scientific Development (10.13039/501100003593) â€“ Brazil (Process number 233849/2014-9).
